        <p style="font-size: 2em"> People are busy, just like you and me. When you want to ask something over a chat, please follow up your "Hello" with the question. I'm sure person on other side will respond as soon as she can.</p>

        <h4>Please do this:</h2>
        <p><i>2:33 AM  </i><b>Spock:</b> Hello Captain Kirk - We will run out of supplies in 5 days. Can you please approve new procurement?</p>
        <p><i>4:55 AM  </i><b>Kirk: </b>Sure Spock. Will do it.</p>
